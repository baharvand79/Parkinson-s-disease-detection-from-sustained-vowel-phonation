AB  - Background: Interest in technologies for quantitative assessment of Parkinson's disease (PD) is growing, particularly those enabling voice and speech analysis. However, clinical validation varies widely, much algorithm data remain unpublished, and real-world use is still limited. Objective: The aim was to provide an overview of the characteristics and validity of commercially available tools that utilize machine learning to assess voice and speech features for identifying PD or assessing disease severity. Methods: The literature was reviewed to (1) identify, (2) compare, and (3) group commercially available tools deployed in smartphone apps and other scalable platforms based on their (1) previous use in PD, (2) feasibility, and (3) successful clinimetric testing. The International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Digital Tools and Technologies Repository; online databases, for example, PubMed; and web pages related to the entities associated with different technologies were searched for tools that use voice assessment. Identified devices were grouped into 3 categories: (1) “recommended,” (2) “suggested,” or (3) “listed.”. Results: Twelve relevant technologies were identified. One was placed in the “recommended” group (“Dysarthria Analyzer”), 6 in the “suggested” group, (“Audeering,” “Aural Analytics,” Canary Speech,” “KI:Elements,” “Modality.ai,” and “Redenlab”), and 5 in the “listed” group (“i-Prognosis,” “No Pa,” and “PdAssist,” as well as “mPower” and “HopkinsPD”). Conclusions: Despite their potential for clinical and research applications, their suitability in real-world environments remains to be determined. © 2025 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

AB  - Sepsis remains a major problem for human health worldwide, thereby manifesting high rates of morbidity and mortality. Sepsis, once understood as a monophasic sustained hyperinflammation, is currently recognized as a dysregulated host response to infection, with both hyperinflammation and immunoparalysis occurring simultaneously from the earliest stages of sepsis, involving multiple organ dysfunctions. Despite the recent progress in the understanding of the pathophysiology underlying sepsis, no specific treatment to restore immune dysregulation in sepsis has been validated in clinical trials. In recent years, treatment for immune checkpoints such as the programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death ligand (PD-1/PD-L) pathway in tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes has been successful in the field of cancer immune therapy. As immune-paralysis in sepsis involves exhausted T-lymphocytes, future clinical applications of checkpoint inhibitors for sepsis are expected. In addition, the functions of PD-1/PD-L on innate lymphoid cells and the role of exosomal forms of PD-L1 warrant further research. Looking back on the history of repeatedly failed clinical trials of immune modulatory therapies for sepsis, sepsis must be recognized as a difficult disease entity for performing clinical trials. A major obstacle that could prevent effective clinical trials of drug candidates is the disease complexity and heterogeneities; clinically diagnosed sepsis could contain multiple sepsis subgroups that suffer different levels of hyper-inflammation and immune-suppression in distinct organs. Thus, the selection of appropriate more homogenous sepsis subgroup is the key for testing the clinical efficacy of experimental therapies targeting specific pathways in either hyperinflammation and/or immunoparalysis. An emerging technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) may help to identify an immune paralysis subgroup who would best be treated by PD-1/PD-L1 pathway inhibitors. © Copyright © 2021 Nakamori, Park and Shimaoka.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) has affected millions of people worldwide and is more prevalent in people, over the age of 50. Even today, with many technologies and advancements, early detection of this disease remains a challenge. This necessitates a need for the machine learning-based automatic approaches that help clinicians to detect this disease accurately in its early stage. Thus, the focus of this research paper is to provide an insightful survey and compare the existing computational intelligence techniques used for PD detection. To save time and increase treatment efficiency, classification has found its place in PD detection. The existing knowledge review indicates that many classification algorithms have been used to achieve better results, but the problem is to identify the most efficient classifier for PD detection. The challenge in identifying the most appropriate classification algorithm lies in their application on local dataset. Thus, in this paper three types of classifiers, namely, Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine and K-nearest neighbor have been discussed on the benchmark (voice) dataset to compare and to know which of these classifiers is the most efficient and accurate for PD classification. The Voice input dataset for these classifiers has been obtained from UCI machine learning repository. ANN with Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm was found to be the best classifier, having highest classification accuracy (95.89%). Moreover, we compared our results with those obtained by Resul Das [“A comparison of multiple classification methods for diagnosis of Parkinson Disease,” Expert Systems and applications, vol. 37, pp 1568–1572, 2010]. © 2021 IETE.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests voice dysfunction is the earliest sign of motor impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD). The complexity and fine motor control involved in vocalization may result in dysfunction here before the limbs. The voice in PD demonstrates characteristic changes on perceptual and acoustic analyses. The physiological and anatomical correlates of these have been investigated through laryngoscopy, stroboscopy, photoglottography, laryngeal electromyography, computed-tomography, pulmonary function testing and aerodynamic assessments. These have revealed numerous abnormalities including incomplete glottic closure and vocal fold hypoadduction/bowing to account for these voice changes. Many of these phenomena are likely related to rigidity or bradykinesia of the laryngeal muscles. The early onset of voice changes is resonant with the pathophysiological insights offered by Braak's hypothesis and murine models of the disease. These physiological abnormalities and pathological models largely stand to support dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic mechanisms being implicated in the pathogenesis of voice dysfunction. This review focuses on characterizing the voice changes in PD. These stand as a promising area of enquiry to further our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and offer potential to be utilized as an early diagnostic biomarker or marker of disease progression. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Most neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are life-threatening, critical, and incurable affecting mainly the elderly population. Early diagnosis is challenging as disease phenotype is very crucial for predicting, preventing the progression, and effective drug discovery. In the last few years, Deep learning (DL) based neural networks are the state-of-the-art models deployed in industries and academics across different areas like natural language processing, image analysis, speech recognition, audio classification, and many more It has been slowly realized that they have a high potential in medical image analysis and diagnostics and medical management in general. As this field is vast and expanding rapidly, we have put focused on existing DL-based models to detect Alzheimer’s and Parkinson's in particular. This study gives a summary of related medical examinations for these diseases. Frameworks and applications of many deep learning models have been discussed. We have given precise notes on pre-processing techniques used by various studies for MRI image analysis. An overview of the application of DL-based models in different stages of medical image analysis has been conferred. It has been realized from the review that more studies are focused on Alzheimer's compared to Parkinson's disease Additionally, we have tabulated the various public datasets available for these diseases. We have highlighted the potential use of a novel biomarker for the early diagnosis of these disorders. Also, some challenges and issues in implementing deep learning techniques for the detection of these diseases have been addressed. Finally, We concluded with some future research directions regarding deep learning techniques for diagnosis of the above diseases. © 2024 The Author(s). Published by Bentham Science Publisher.

AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting over 6 million people globally. Although there are symptomatic treatments that can increase the survivability of the disease, there are no curative treatments. The prevalence of PD and disability-adjusted life years continue to increase steadily, leading to a growing burden on patients, their fam-ilies, society and the economy. Dopaminergic medications can significantly slow down the progression of PD when applied during the early stages. However, these treatments often become less effective with the disease progression. Early diagnosis of PD is crucial for immediate interventions so that the patients can remain self-sufficient for the longest period of time possible. Unfortunately, diagnoses are often late, due to factors such as a global shortage of neurologists skilled in early PD diagnosis. Computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) tools, based on artificial intelligence methods, that can perform automated diagnosis of PD, are gaining attention from healthcare services. In this re-view, we have identified 63 studies published between January 2011 and July 2021, that proposed deep learning models for an automated diagnosis of PD, using various types of modalities like brain analysis (SPECT, PET, MRI and EEG), and motion symptoms (gait, handwriting, speech and EMG). From these studies, we identify the best performing deep learning model reported for each modality and highlight the current limitations that are hindering the adoption of such CAD tools in healthcare. Finally, we propose new directions to further the studies on deep learning in the automated detection of PD, in the hopes of improving the utility, applicability and impact of such tools to improve early detection of PD globally. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, globally affecting men and women at an exponentially growing rate, with currently no cure. Disease progression starts when dopaminergic neurons begin to die. In PD, the loss of neurotransmitter, dopamine is responsible for the overall communication of neural cells throughout the body. Clinical symptoms of PD are slowness of movement, involuntary muscular contractions, speech & writing changes, lessened automatic movement, and chronic tremors in the body. PD occurs in both familial and sporadic forms and modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors and socioeconomic conditions cause PD. Early detectable diagnostics and treatments have been developed in the last several decades. However, we still do not have precise early detectable biomarkers and therapeutic agents/drugs that prevent and/or delay the disease process. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) science and machine learning tools have been promising in identifying early detectable markers with a greater rate of accuracy compared to past forms of treatment and diagnostic processes. Artificial intelligence refers to the intelligence exhibited by machines or software, distinct from the intelligence observed in humans that is based on neural networks in a form and can be used to diagnose the longevity and disease severity of disease. The term Machine Learning or Neural Networks is a blanket term used to identify an emerging technology that is created to work in the way of a “human brain” using many intertwined neurons to achieve the same level of raw intelligence as that of a brain. These processes have been used for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, to assess the severity of the patient's condition. In the current article, we discuss the prevalence and incidence of PD, and currently available diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. We also highlighted currently available artificial intelligence science and machine learning tools and their applications to detect disease and develop therapeutic interventions. © 2024

AB  - Background: Approximately 60% to 80% of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience cognitive impairment that impacts on their quality of life. Cognitive decline is a core feature of the disease and can often present before the onset of motor symptoms. Cognitive training may be a useful non-pharmacological intervention that could help to maintain or improve cognition and quality of life for people with PD dementia (PDD) or PD-related mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI). Objectives: To determine whether cognitive training (targeting single or multiple domains) improves cognition in people with PDD and PD-MCI or other clearly defined forms of cognitive impairment in people with PD. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Trials Register (8 August 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. We searched reference lists and trial registers, searched relevant reviews in the area and conference proceedings. We also contacted experts for clarifications on data and ongoing trials. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials where the participants had PDD or PD-MCI, and where the intervention was intended to train general or specific areas of cognitive function, targeting either a single domain or multiple domains of cognition, and was compared to a control condition. Multicomponent interventions that also included motor or other elements were considered eligible. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts, and full-text articles for inclusion in the review. Two review authors also independently undertook extraction of data and assessment of methodological quality. We used GRADE methods to assess the overall quality of the evidence. Main results: Seven studies with a total of 225 participants met the inclusion criteria for this review. All seven studies compared the effects of a cognitive training intervention to a control intervention at the end of treatment periods lasting four to eight weeks. Six studies included people with PD living in the community. These six studies recruited people with single-domain (executive) or multiple-domain mild cognitive impairment in PD. Four of these studies identified participants with MCI using established diagnostic criteria, and two included both people with PD-MCI and people with PD who were not cognitively impaired. One study recruited people with a diagnosis of PD dementia who were living in long-term care settings. The cognitive training intervention in three studies targeted a single cognitive domain, whilst in four studies multiple domains of cognitive function were targeted. The comparison groups either received no intervention or took part in recreational activities (sports, music, arts), speech or language exercises, computerised motor therapy, or motor rehabilitation combined with recreational activity. We found no clear evidence that cognitive training improved global cognition. Although cognitive training was associated with higher scores on global cognition at the end of treatment, the result was imprecise and not statistically significant (6 trials, 178 participants, standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.03 to 0.59; low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference at the end of treatment between cognitive training and control interventions on executive function (5 trials, 112 participants; SMD 0.10, 95% CI −0.28 to 0.48; low-certainty evidence) or visual processing (3 trials, 64 participants; SMD 0.30, 95% CI −0.21 to 0.81; low-certainty evidence). The evidence favoured the cognitive training group on attention (5 trials, 160 participants; SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.68; low-certainty evidence) and verbal memory (5 trials, 160 participants; SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.69; low-certainty evidence), but these effects were less certain in sensitivity analyses that excluded a study in which only a minority of the sample were cognitively impaired. There was no evidence of differences between treatment and control groups in activities of daily living (3 trials, 67 participants; SMD 0.03, 95% CI −0.47 to 0.53; low-certainty evidence) or quality of life (5 trials, 147 participants; SMD −0.01, 95% CI −0.35 to 0.33; low-certainty evidence). There was very little information on adverse events. We considered the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes to be low due to risk of bias in the included studies and imprecision of the results. We identified six ongoing trials recruiting participants with PD-MCI, but no ongoing trials of cognitive training for people with PDD. Authors' conclusions: This review found no evidence that people with PD-MCI or PDD who receive cognitive training for four to eight weeks experience any important cognitive improvements at the end of training. However, this conclusion was based on a small number of studies with few participants, limitations of study design and execution, and imprecise results. There is a need for more robust, adequately powered studies of cognitive training before conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of cognitive training for people with PDD and PD-MCI. Studies should use formal criteria to diagnose cognitive impairments, and there is a particular need for more studies testing the efficacy of cognitive training in people with PDD.

AB  - Despite significant advances on automatic detection of Parkinson's disease (PD) based on speech, several open challenges still need to be addressed before a validated computer-aided diagnosis system can be used practically. One of these challenges lies in considering the potential corruption of speech caused by environmental noises, which may be nonstationary and exhibit varied characteristics. Speech features automatically extracted from diadochokinetic (DDK) tests have shown utility in assessing articulatory aspects of speech impairment in PD. The authors propose an automatic PD detection system based on a multicondition training (MCT) framework. The approach considers various types of realistic acoustic noise in addition to DDK recordings and uses machine learning for feature selection and classification. For each experiment, the noise addition process did not artificially increase the dataset size, as each subject's recordings were either affected by a single noise type or had no injected noise. To compare with this MCT-based approach, an alternative method is examined where training involves speech samples affected by uniform noise conditions. This method, referred to as single-condition training (SCT), involves training with features either from the original waveforms or from waveforms altered by noise addition, ensuring uniformity by using the same type of realistic noise across all the training samples. The benefit of the MCT approach is demonstrated by showing the results obtained in classification tests to discriminate patients affected by PD from healthy individuals. The experiments performed were based on an in-house voice recording database composed of 30 individuals diagnosed with PD and 30 healthy controls. The speech samples were recorded using a smartphone as a data collection device so that the samples were not affected by speech compression algorithms. Both approaches (SCT and MCT) were tested against each specific type of noise under consideration. The mean accuracy rates showed improvements of 1.68%, 5.18%, and 4.39% for/pa/,/ta/, and/ka/ syllables, respectively, when using MCT compared with SCT. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first strategy published in the literature to deal with the potential corruption of speech by environmental noise in automatic PD detection aid systems based on DDK tests. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a serious movement disorder that may eventually progress to mild cognitive dysfunction (MCI) and dementia. According to the Parkinson’s foundation, one million Americans were diagnosed with PD and almost 10 million individuals suffer from the disease worldwide. An early and precise clinical diagnosis of PD will ensure an early initiation of effective therapeutic treatments, which will potentially slow down the progression of the disease and improve the quality of life for patients and their caregivers. Machine and deep learning are promising technologies that may assist and support clinicians in providing an objective and reliable diagnosis of the disease based upon significant and unique features identified from relevant medical data. In this paper, the author provides a comprehensive review of the artificial intelligence techniques that were recently proposed during the period from 2016 to 2022 for the screening and staging of PD as well as the identification of the biomarkers of the disease based on Electroencephalography (EEG), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), speech tests, handwriting exams, and sensory data. In addition, the author highlights the current and future trends for PD diagnosis based machine and deep learning and discusses the limitations, challenges, potential future solutions, and recommendations for a reliable application of machine and deep learning for PD detection and screening. © 2023 by the author.

AB  - Background and aim: Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease. It is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, which can influence the control over the illness. Therefore, the possibility of diagnosing Parkinson's disease at an earlier stage, and possibly prognosticate it, could be an advantage. Given this, a literature review that covers current studies in the field is relevant. Methods: The aim of this study is to present a systematic literature review in which the models used for the diagnosis and prognosis of Parkinson's disease through voice and speech assessment are elucidated. Three databases were consulted to obtain the studies between 2019 and 2023: SienceDirect, IEEE Xplore and ACM Library. Results: One hundred and six studies were considered eligible, considering the definition of inclusion and exclusion criteria. The vast majority of these studies (94.34%) focus on diagnosing the disease, while the remainder (11.32%) focus on prognosis. Conclusion: Voice analysis for the diagnosis and prognosis of Parkinson's disease using machine learning techniques can be achieved, with very satisfactory performance results, like is demonstrated in this systematic literature review. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Background: The diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease is currently based on clinical evaluation. Despite clinical hallmarks, unfortunately, the error rate is still significant. Low in-vivo diagnostic accuracy of clinical evaluation mainly relies on the lack of quantitative biomarkers for an objective motor performance assessment. Non-invasive technologies, such as wearable sensors, coupled with machine learning algorithms, assess quantitatively and objectively the motor performances, with possible benefits either for in-clinic and at-home settings. We conducted a systematic review of the literature on machine learning algorithms embedded in smart devices in Parkinson’s disease diagnosis. Methods: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we searched PubMed for articles published between December, 2007 and July, 2023, using a search string combining “Parkinson’s disease” AND (“healthy” or “control”) AND “diagnosis”, within the Groups and Outcome domains. Additional search terms included “Algorithm”, “Technology” and “Performance”. Results: From 89 identified studies, 47 met the inclusion criteria based on the search string and four additional studies were included based on the Authors’ expertise. Gait emerged as the most common parameter analysed by machine learning models, with Support Vector Machines as the prevalent algorithm. The results suggest promising accuracy with complex algorithms like Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and K-Nearest Neighbours. Discussion: Despite the promise shown by machine learning algorithms, real-world applications may still face limitations. This review suggests that integrating machine learning with wearable sensors has the potential to improve Parkinson’s disease diagnosis. These tools could provide clinicians with objective data, potentially aiding in earlier detection. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Facial movements are crucial for social and emotional interaction and well-being. Reduced facial expressions (i.e., hypomimia) is a common feature in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and previous studies linked this manifestation to both motor symptoms of the disease and altered emotion recognition and processing. Nevertheless, research on facial motor impairment in PD has been rather scarce and only a limited number of clinical evaluation tools are available, often suffering from poor validation processes and high inter- and intra-rater variability. In recent years, the availability of technology-enhanced quantification methods of facial movements, such as automated video analysis and machine learning application, led to increasing interest in studying hypomimia in PD. In this narrative review, we summarize the current knowledge on pathophysiological hypotheses at the basis of hypomimia in PD, with particular focus on the association between reduced facial expressions and emotional processing and analyze the current evaluation tools and management strategies for this symptom, as well as future research perspectives. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The preliminary diagnosis and evaluation of the presence and/or severity of Parkinson's disease is crucial in controlling the progress of the disease. Real-time, non-invasive methodologies based on machine learning-enhanced voice analysis are gathering more interest as the potential of this field unveils. Specifically, acoustic features are employed in many machine learning techniques, and could also function as indicators of the overall state of the subjects’ voice: this review aims at identifying the most widely employed and promising feature-based machine learning methodologies, evidencing baselines and state-of-the-art solutions. A total of 102 works plus 5 review articles were selected from the IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Elsevier, and Web of Science electronic databases. A statistical assessment is performed identifying the most frequently used features as well as those deemed as most effective; an overview of algorithms, public datasets, toolboxes, and general metadata is also performed. According to our results, Jitter, Shimmer, Harmonic-to-Noise Ratio, Fundamental Frequency, and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients are the mostly adopted features. In addition, it is worth noting a fair prevalence of glottal-like models and additional filtering options, such as Detrended Fluctuation Analysis. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily affects motor functions and can lead to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia in its advanced stages. With approximately 10 million people diagnosed globally—1 to 1.8 per 1,000 individuals, according to reports by the Japan Times and the Parkinson Foundation—early and accurate diagnosis of PD is crucial for improving patient outcomes. While numerous studies have utilized machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for PD recognition, existing surveys are limited in scope, often focusing on single data modalities and failing to capture the potential of multimodal approaches. To address these gaps, this study presents a comprehensive review of PD recognition systems across diverse data modalities, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), gait-based pose analysis, gait sensory data, handwriting analysis, speech test data, Electroencephalography (EEG), and multimodal fusion techniques. Based on over 342 articles from leading scientific databases, this review examines key aspects such as data collection methods, settings, feature representations, and system performance, with a focus on recognition accuracy and robustness. Notably, limitations such as the lack of robust multimodal frameworks and challenges in continuous PD recognition are identified, underscoring the need for innovative solutions. The review highlights significant advancements in PD recognition, particularly the transition from handcrafted feature engineering to DL-based methods. Furthermore, it explores promising trends in multimodal approaches, offering insights into overcoming existing challenges such as data scarcity, model generalization, and computational efficiency. The study emphasizes the importance of integrating diverse data sources to achieve higher diagnostic accuracy and reliability. This survey aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers, providing actionable guidance for the development of next-generation PD recognition systems. By leveraging diverse data modalities and cutting-edge machine learning paradigms, this work contributes to advancing the state of PD diagnostics and improving patient care through innovative, multimodal approaches. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is increasingly applied to several medical diagnosis tasks, including a wide range of diseases. Importantly, various ML models were developed to address the complexity of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) diagnosis. PD is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor and non-motor disorders where its syndromes affect the daily lives of patients. Several Computer Aided Diagnosis and Detection (CADD) systems based on hand-crafted ML algorithms achieved promising results in distinguishing PD patients from Healthy Control (HC) subjects and other Parkinsonian syndrome categories using clinical data (e.g., speech and gait impairments) and medical imaging [e.g., Position Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT)]. Despite the good performance of hand-crafted ML algorithms, there is still a problem linked to the features’ extraction and selection. In fact, Deep Learning DL has provided an ultimate solution for the features’ extraction and selection related issue. An important number of studies on the diagnosis of PD using DL algorithms were developed recently. This study provides an overview of the application of hand-crafted ML algorithms and DL techniques for PD diagnosis. It also introduces key concepts for understanding the application of ML methods to diagnose PD. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of neuronal cells, which leads to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive defects. Despite the advancements in treatment strategies, the management of PD is still a challenging event. Early prediction and diagnosis of PD are of utmost importance for effective management of PD. In addition, the classification of patients with PD as compared to normal healthy individuals also imposes drawbacks in the early diagnosis of PD. To address these challenges, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models have been implicated in the diagnosis, prediction, and treatment of PD. Recent times have also demonstrated the implication of AI and ML models in the classification of PD based on neuroimaging methods, speech recording, gait abnormalities, and others. Herein, we have briefly discussed the role of AI and ML in the diagnosis, treatment, and identification of novel biomarkers in the progression of PD. We have also highlighted the role of AI and ML in PD management through altered lipidomics and gut-brain axis. We briefly explain the role of early PD detection through AI and ML algorithms based on speech recordings, handwriting patterns, gait abnormalities, and neuroimaging techniques. Further, the review discuss the potential role of the metaverse, the Internet of Things, and electronic health records in the effective management of PD to improve the quality of life. Lastly, we also focused on the implementation of AI and ML-algorithms in neurosurgical process and drug discovery. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background and objective: Speech impairment is an early symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). This study has summarized the literature related to speech and voice in detecting PD and assessing its severity. Methods: A systematic review of the literature from 2010 to 2021 to investigate analysis methods and signal features. The keywords “Automatic analysis” in conjunction with “PD speech” or “PD voice” were used, and the PubMed and ScienceDirect databases were searched. A total of 838 papers were found on the first run, of which 189 were selected. One hundred and forty-seven were found to be suitable for the review. The different datasets, recording protocols, signal analysis methods and features that were reported are listed. Values of the features that separate PD patients from healthy controls were tabulated. Finally, the barriers that limit the wide use of computerized speech analysis are discussed. Results: Speech and voice may be valuable markers for PD. However, large differences between the datasets make it difficult to compare different studies. In addition, speech analytic methods that are not informed by physiological understanding may alienate clinicians. Conclusions: The potential usefulness of speech and voice for the detection and assessment of PD is confirmed by evidence from the classification and correlation results. © 2022

AB  - Background/Objectives: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, characterised by cardinal motor features and a multitude of non-motor manifestations. Among them, cognitive impairment in PD has been recognised as a defined clinical entity, and it might lead to an increased risk of developing dementia. Consequently, the present review aimed to ascertain the available interventions for the training of cognitive abilities in persons with PD (PwPD). Methods: PRISMA guidelines were followed to select studies in the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Two independent reviewers conducted the different phases of the review, and a third expert was called in to address any doubts/conflicts. Randomised controlled trials and randomised clinical trials concerning cognitive training with cognitive outcomes in PwPD were selected. Results: A total of 28 articles were included. The considered studies applied various experimental interventions for the training of cognitive functions in PwPD: computer-based platforms, exergames, paper-and-pencil programmes, dual-task or treadmill training with action observation therapy, motor imagery, and virtual reality components, interventions targeting precise cognitive domain, tele-rehabilitation, transcranial direct current stimulation, structured cognitive training, and multimodal treatments. Cognitive functions were assessed employing neuropsychological tests, self-report questionnaires, and computerised batteries. Conclusions: Overall, the review reported better performances in the experimental groups compared to the control groups, in several cognitive domains. Structured cognitive training emerged as the most effective strategy to enhance cognitive functioning in PwPD. However, further studies are necessary to determine the most appropriate and useful training and to develop interventions that also consider patients’ quality of life. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative illness triggered by decreased dopamine secretion. Deep Learning (DL) has gained substantial attention in PD diagnosis research, with an increase in the number of published papers in this discipline. PD detection using DL has presented more promising outcomes as compared with common machine learning approaches. This article aims to conduct a bibliometric analysis and a literature review focusing on the prominent developments taking place in this area. To achieve the target of the study, we retrieved and analyzed the available research papers in the Scopus database. Following that, we conducted a bibliometric analysis to inspect the structure of keywords, authors, and countries in the surveyed studies by providing visual representations of the bibliometric data using VOSviewer software. The study also provides an in-depth review of the literature focusing on different indicators of PD, deployed approaches, and performance metrics. The outcomes indicate the firm development of PD diagnosis using DL approaches over time and a large diversity of studies worldwide. Additionally, the literature review presented a research gap in DL approaches related to incremental learning, particularly in relation to big data analysis. © 2024

AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, frequently presents with early-stage speech impairments. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning (DL), have significantly enhanced PD diagnosis through the analysis of speech data. Nevertheless, the progress of research is restricted by the limited availability of publicly accessible speech-based PD datasets, primarily due to privacy concerns. The goal of this systematic review is to explore the current landscape of speech-based DL approaches for PD classification, based on 33 scientific works published between January 2020 and March 2024. We discuss their available resources, capabilities, and potential limitations, and issues related to bias, explainability, and privacy. Furthermore, this review provides an overview of publicly accessible speech-based datasets and open-source material for PD. The DL approaches identified are categorized into end-to-end (E2E) learning, transfer learning (TL), and deep acoustic feature extraction (DAFE). Among E2E approaches, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are prevalent, though Transformers are increasingly popular. E2E approaches face challenges such as limited data and computational resources, especially with Transformers. TL addresses these issues by providing more robust PD diagnosis and better generalizability across languages. DAFE aims to improve the explainability and interpretability of results by examining the specific effects of deep features on both other DL approaches and more traditional machine learning (ML) methods. However, it often underperforms compared to E2E and TL approaches. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Speech impairment is a common and disabling symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD), affecting communication and quality of life. Advances in digital speech processing and artificial intelligence have revolutionized objective speech analysis. Given the complex nature of speech impairment, acoustic speech analysis offers unique biomarkers for neuroprotective treatments from the prodromal stages of PD. Digital speech biomarkers can monitor levodopa-induced motor complications, detect the effects of deep brain stimulation, and provide feedback for behavioral speech therapy. This review updates the mechanisms underlying speech impairment, the impact of speech phenotypes, and the effects of interventions on speech. We evaluate the strengths, potential weaknesses, and suitability of promising digital speech biomarkers in PD for capturing disease progression and treatment efficacy. Additionally, we explore the translational potential of PD speech biomarkers to other neuropsychiatric diseases, offering insights into motion, cognition, and emotion. Finally, we highlight knowledge gaps and suggest directions for future research to enhance the use of quantitative speech measures in disease-modifying clinical trials. The findings demonstrate that one year is sufficient to detect disease progression in early PD through speech biomarkers. Voice quality, pitch, loudness, and articulation measures appear to capture the efficacy of treatment interventions most effectively. Certain speech features, such as loudness and articulation rate, behave oppositely in different neurological diseases, offering valuable insights for differential diagnosis. In conclusion, this review highlights speech as a biomarker in tracking disease progression, especially in the prodromal stages of PD, and calls for further longitudinal studies to establish its efficacy across diverse populations. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Background: Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that has been ranked second after Alzheimer’s disease worldwide. Early diagnosis of PD is crucial to combat against PD to allow patients to deal with it properly. However, there is no medical test(s) available to diagnose PD conclusively. Therefore, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems offered a better solution to make the necessary data-driven decisions and assist the physician. Numerous studies were conducted to propose CAD to diagnose PD in the early stages. No comprehensive reviews have been conducted to summarize the role of AI tools to combat PD. Objective: The study aimed to explore and summarize the applications of neural networks to diagnose PD. Methods: PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) was followed to conduct this scoping review. To identify the relevant studies, both medical databases (e.g., PubMed) and technical databases (IEEE) were searched. Three reviewers carried out the study selection and extracted the data from the included studies independently. Then, the narrative approach was adopted to synthesis the extracted data. Results: Out of 1061 studies, 91 studies satisfied the eligibility criteria in this review. About half of the included studies have implemented artificial neural networks to diagnose PD. Numerous studies included focused on the freezing of gait (FoG). Biomedical voice and signal datasets were the most commonly used data types to develop and validate these models. However, MRI-and CT-scan images were also utilized in the included studies. Conclusion: Neural networks play an integral and substantial role in combating PD. Many possible applications of neural networks were identified in this review, however, most of them are limited up to research purposes. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background: Parkinson’s disease has a significant impact on vocal characteristics and speech patterns, making them potential biomarkers for monitoring disease progression. To effectively utilise these biomarkers, it is essential to understand how they evolve over time as this degenerative disease progresses. Objectives: This review aims to identify the most used vocal features in Parkinson’s disease monitoring and to track the temporal changes observed in each feature. Methods: An online database search was conducted to identify studies on voice and speech changes associated with Parkinson’s disease progression. The analysis examined the features and their temporal changes to identify potential feature classes and trends. Results: Eighteen features were identified and categorised into three main aspects of speech: articulation, phonation and prosody. While twelve of these features exhibited measurable variations in Parkinsonian voices compared to those of healthy individuals, insights into long-term changes were limited. Conclusions: Vocal features can effectively discriminate Parkinsonian voices and may be used to monitor changes through disease progression. These changes remain underexplored and necessitate more evidence from long-term studies. The additional evidence could provide clinical insights into the disease and enhance the effectiveness of automated voice-based monitoring. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Parkinson's Disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurological conditions, affecting a significant portion of the elderly population worldwide. Characterized by motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia, as well as non-motor symptoms like hypomimia (reduced facial expressiveness), PD presents significant diagnostic challenges, especially in its early stages. In this context, this systematic review (SR) aims to explore machine learning and deep learning techniques in detecting PD through facial image analysis. The study identifies the key works in the field, the computational techniques employed, and the datasets used. The main findings suggest that facial phenotyping can be a strong indicator for the early diagnosis of PD. Various approaches, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other deep learning models, have shown promise in detecting subtle changes in facial expressions associated with hypomimia. Integrating multimodal data sources, such as voice recordings, hand-drawn sketches, movement analysis, and facial images, has also demonstrated the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy. This review highlights the potential of facial image analysis as an innovative approach for the early detection of PD, which could lead to more timely and effective interventions.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - While extensive research has documented the cognitive changes associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD), a relatively small portion of the empirical literature investigated the language abilities of individuals with PD. Recently, artificial intelligence applied to linguistic data has shown promising results in predicting the clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, but a deeper investigation of the current literature available on PD is lacking. This systematic review investigates the nature of language disorders in PD by assessing the contribution of machine learning (ML) to the classification of patients with PD. A total of 10 studies published between 2016 and 2023 were included in this review. Tasks used to elicit language were mainly structured or unstructured narrative discourse. Transcriptions were mostly analyzed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The classification accuracy (%) ranged from 43 to 94, sensitivity (%) ranged from 8 to 95, specificity (%) ranged from 3 to 100, AUC (%) ranged from 32 to 97. The most frequent optimal linguistic measures were lexico-semantic (40%), followed by NLP-extracted features (26%) and morphological consistency features (20%). Artificial intelligence applied to linguistic markers provides valuable insights into PD. However, analyzing measures derived from narrative discourse can be time-consuming, and utilizing ML requires specialized expertise. Moving forward, it is important to focus on facilitating the integration of both narrative discourse analysis and artificial intelligence into clinical practice. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins and impaired protein degradation mechanisms. Dysregulation of protein degradation processes, including autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool to enhance our understanding of protein degradation in PD. This abstract provides an overview of the advancements in studying protein degradation in PD with the aid of AI. The integration of AI techniques, such as machine learning and data mining, has enabled the identification and characterization of protein degradation pathways involved in PD. By analyzing large-scale protein-protein interaction networks, AI algorithms have revealed key interactions and pathways underlying protein degradation dysfunction in PD. Furthermore, AI models can predict the efficiency of protein degradation processes and identify potential targets for enhancing protein degradation in PD, aiding in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.AI-based approaches have also been instrumental in drug discovery and target identification, as they can screen vast databases of compounds to identify potential drugs or small molecules that modulate protein degradation pathways relevant to PD. Additionally, deep learning algorithms have facilitated the analysis of protein structures, predicting protein stability and folding patterns that impact protein degradation. Moreover, AI has played a crucial role in the identification of protein biomarkers associated with protein degradation dysfunction in PD. These biomarkers can aid in early diagnosis and monitoring of the disease, enabling timely intervention and personalized treatment strategies. The advancements presented in this abstract highlight the transformative potential of AI in elucidating the intricate mechanisms of protein degradation in PD. Collaborations between AI researchers, biologists, and clinicians are essential to translate these findings into effective diagnostic tools and therapeutic interventions for PD patients. © 2023 by author(s).

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and other neuronal populations. The worldwide prevalence of PD is over 7 million and has been increasing more rapidly than many other neurodegenerative disorders. PD symptoms can be broadly divided into motor (slowness, stiffness, tremor) and non-motor symptoms (such as depression, dementia, psychosis, orthostatic hypotension). Patients can also have prodromal symptoms of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, hyposmia, and constipation. The diagnosis of PD is mainly clinical, but dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography can improve the accuracy of the diagnosis. Dopamine based therapies are used for the treatment of motor symptoms. Non-motor symptoms are treated with other medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (depression/anxiety), acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (dementia), and atypical antipsychotics (psychosis). Patients with motor fluctuations or uncontrolled tremor, benefit from deep brain stimulation. Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel is an alternative to deep brain stimulation for uncontrolled motor fluctuations. Rehabilitative therapies such as physical, occupational, and speech therapy are important during all stages of the disease. Management of PD is complex but there have been significant advancements in the treatment of motor and non-motor symptoms over the past few years. This review discusses the updates in the medical and surgical management of PD. © 2020 Nemade D et al.

AB  - Background: Parkinson’s disease is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disorder. Its diagnosis is challenging and mainly relies on clinical aspects. At present, no biomarker is available to obtain a diagnosis of certainty in vivo. Objective: The present review aims at describing machine learning algorithms as they have been variably applied to different aspects of Parkinson’s disease diagnosis and characterization. Methods: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed in December 2019, resulting in 230 publications obtained with the following search query: “Machine Learning” “AND” “Parkinson Disease”. Results: The obtained publications were divided into 6 categories, based on different application fields: “Gait Analysis - Motor Evaluation”, “Upper Limb Motor and Tremor Evaluation”, “Handwriting and typing evaluation”, “Speech and Phonation evaluation”, “Neuroimaging and Nuclear Medicine evaluation”, “Metabolomics application”, after excluding the papers of general topic. As a result, a total of 166 articles were analyzed after elimination of papers written in languages other than English or not directly related to the selected topics. Conclusion: Machine learning algorithms are computer-based statistical approaches that can be trained and are able to find common patterns from big amounts of data. The machine learning approaches can help clinicians in classifying patients according to several variables at the same time. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Background Parkinson's Disease is the second most common neurological disease in over 60s. Cognitive impairment is a major clinical symptom, with risk of severe dysfunction up to 20 years post-diagnosis. Processes for detection and diagnosis of cognitive impairments are not sufficient to predict decline at an early stage for significant impact. Ageing populations, neurologist shortages and subjective interpretations reduce the effectiveness of decisions and diagnoses. Researchers are now utilising machine learning for detection and diagnosis of cognitive impairment based on symptom presentation and clinical investigation. This work aims to provide an overview of published studies applying machine learning to detecting and diagnosing cognitive impairment, evaluate the feasibility of implemented methods, their impacts, and provide suitable recommendations for methods, modalities and outcomes. Methods To provide an overview of the machine learning techniques, data sources and modalities used for detection and diagnosis of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's Disease, we conducted a review of studies published on the PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus and ScienceDirect databases. 70 studies were included in this review, with the most relevant information extracted from each. From each study, strategy, modalities, sources, methods and outcomes were extracted. Results Literatures demonstrate that machine learning techniques have potential to provide considerable insight into investigation of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's Disease. Our review demonstrates the versatility of machine learning in analysing a wide range of different modalities for the detection and diagnosis of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's Disease, including imaging, EEG, speech and more, yielding notable diagnostic accuracy. Conclusions Machine learning based interventions have the potential to glean meaningful insight from data, and may offer non-invasive means of enhancing cognitive impairment assessment, providing clear and formidable potential for implementation of machine learning into clinical practice. © 2024 Altham et al.

AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the neural, behavioral, and physiological systems of the brain. This disease is also known as tremor. The common symptoms of this disease are a slowness of movement known as ‘bradykinesia’, loss of automatic movements, speech/writing changes, and difficulty with walking at early stages. To solve these issues and to enhance the diagnostic process of PD, machine learning (ML) algorithms have been implemented for the categorization of subjective disease and healthy controls (HC) with comparable medical appearances. To provide a far-reaching outline of data modalities and artificial intelligence techniques that have been utilized in the analysis and diagnosis of PD, we conducted a literature analysis of research papers published up until 2022. A total of 112 research papers were included in this study, with an examination of their targets, data sources and different types of datasets, ML algorithms, and associated outcomes. The results showed that ML approaches and new biomarkers have a lot of promise for being used in clinical decision-making, resulting in a more systematic and informed diagnosis of PD. In this study, some major challenges were addressed along with a future recommendation. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting people worldwide. The PD symptoms are divided into motor and non-motor symptoms. Detection of PD is very crucial and essential. Such challenges can be overcome by applying artificial intelligence to diagnose PD. Many studies have also proposed the implementation of computer-aided diagnosis for the detection of PD. This systematic review comprehensively analyzed all appropriate algorithms for detecting and assessing PD based on the literature from 2012 to 2023 which are conducted as per PRISMA model. This review focused on motor symptoms, namely handwriting dynamics, voice impairments and gait, multimodal features, and brain observation using single photon emission computed tomography, magnetic resonance and electroencephalogram signals. The significant challenges are critically analyzed, and appropriate recommendations are provided. The critical discussion of this review article can be helpful in today's PD community in such a way that it allows clinicians to provide proper treatment and timely medication. © 2023, Korean Society of Medical and Biological Engineering.

AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a devastating neurological disease that cannot be identified with traditional plasma experiments, necessitating the development of a faster, less expensive diagnostic instrument. Due to the difficulty of quantifying PD in the past, doctors have tended to focus on some signs while ignoring others, primarily relying on an intuitive assessment scale because of the disease’s characteristics, which include loss of motor control and speech that can be utilized to detect and diagnose this disease. It is an illness that impacts both motion and non-motion functions. It takes years to develop and has a wide range of clinical symptoms and prognoses. Parkinson’s patients commonly display non-motor symptoms such as sleep problems, neurocognitive ailments, and cognitive impairment long before the diagnosis, even though scientists have been working to develop designs for diagnosing and categorizing the disease, only noticeable defects such as movement patterns, speech, or writing skills are offered in this paper. This article provides a thorough analysis of several AI-based ML and DL techniques used to diagnose PD and their influence on developing additional research directions. It follows the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). This review also examines the current state of PD diagnosis and the potential applications of data-driven AI technology. It ends with a discussion of future developments, which aids in filling critical gaps in the current Parkinson’s study. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Due to the complicated nature of Parkinson disease (PD), a number of subjective considerations (eg, staging schemes, clinical assessment tools, or questionnaires) on how best to assess clinical deficits and monitor clinical progression have been published; however, none of these considerations include a comprehensive, objective assessment of all functional areas of neurocognition affected by PD (eg, motor, memory, speech, language, executive function, autonomic function, sensory function, behavior, and sleep). This paper highlights the increasing use of digital health technology (eg, smartphones, tablets, and wearable devices) for the classification, staging, and monitoring of PD. Furthermore, this Viewpoint proposes a foundation for a new staging schema that builds from multiple clinically implemented scales (eg, Hoehn and Yahr Scale and Berg Balance Scale) for ease and homogeneity, while also implementing digital health technology to expand current staging protocols. This proposed staging system foundation aims to provide an objective, symptom-specific assessment of all functional areas of neurocognition via inherent device capabilities (eg, device sensors and human-device interactions). As individuals with PD may manifest different symptoms at different times across the spectrum of neurocognition, the modernization of assessments that include objective, symptom-specific monitoring is imperative for providing personalized medicine and maintaining individual quality of life. ©John Michael Templeton, Christian Poellabauer, Sandra Schneider, Morteza Rahimi, Taofeek Braimoh, Fhaheem Tadamarry, Jason Margolesky, Shanna Burke, Zeina Al Masry.

AB  - Introduction. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurological disorder. Patients with PD were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in many different ways. This study's principal purpose is to assess PD patients' vulnerability to COVID-19 and its consequences. Method. This systematic review was performed based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes (PRISMA) guidelines. A thorough search was conducted in the Medline (through PubMed) and Scopus databases from inception to January 30, 2022. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist was used to evaluate the studies. Results. Most of the studies (38%) had been conducted in Italy. Of the total number of studies, 17 (58%) were cross-sectional, seven (22%) were cohort, four (12%) were quasiexperimental, two (6%) were case-control, and one (3%) was a qualitative study. The PD duration in patients ranged from 3.26 to 13.40 years (IQR1: 5.7 yrs., median: 3.688 yrs., and IQR3: 8.815 yrs.). Meanwhile, the sample size ranged from 12 to 30872 participants (IQR1: 46, median: 96, and IQR3: 211). Despite worsening PD symptoms in the targeted population (persons with COVID-19 and Parkinson's disease), some studies found PD to be a risk factor for more severe COVID-19 disease. There are many adverse effects during the pandemic period in PD patients such as abnormalities of motor, nonmotor functioning, clinical outcomes, activities of daily living, and other outcomes. Conclusion. This study confirmed the negative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on health-related quality of life and its determinants in patients with PD and their caregivers. Thus, due to the worsening symptoms of PD patients in the current pandemic, these people should be given more care and supervision to minimize their coronavirus exposure.  © 2023 Sorayya Rezayi et al.

AB  - In recent years, machine learning and deep learning have shown potential for improving Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis, one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. This comprehensive analysis examines machine learning and deep learning-based Parkinson's disease diagnosis using MRI, speech, and handwriting datasets. To thoroughly analyze PD, this study collected data from scientific literature, experimental investigations, publicly accessible datasets, and global health reports. This study examines the worldwide historical setting of Parkinson's disease, focusing on its increasing prevalence and inequities in treatment access across various regions. A comprehensive summary consolidates essential findings from clinical investigations and pertinent datasets related to Parkinson's disease management. The worldwide context, prospective treatments, therapies, and drugs for Parkinson's disease have been thoroughly examined. This analysis identifies significant research deficiencies and suggests future methods, emphasizing the necessity for more extensive and diverse datasets and improved model accessibility. The current study proposes the Meta-Park model for diagnosing Parkinson's disease, achieving training, testing, and validation accuracy of 97.67 %, 95 %, and 94.04 %. This method provides a dependable and scalable way to improve clinical decision-making in managing Parkinson's disease. This research seeks to provide innovative, data-driven decisions for early diagnosis and effective treatment by merging the proposed method with a thorough examination of existing interventions, providing renewed hope to patients and the medical community. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.
