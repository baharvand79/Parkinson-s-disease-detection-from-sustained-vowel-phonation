However, clinical validation varies widely, much algorithm data remain unpublished, and real-world use is still limited. Objective: The aim was to provide an overview of the characteristics and validity of commercially available tools that utilize machine learning to assess voice and speech features for identifying PD or assessing disease severity. Methods: The literature was reviewed to (1) identify, (2) compare, and (3) group commercially available tools deployed in smartphone apps and other scalable platforms based on their (1) previous use in PD, (2) feasibility, and (3) successful clinimetric testing. The International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Digital Tools and Technologies Repository; online databases, for example, PubMed; and web pages related to the entities associated with different technologies were searched for tools that use voice assessment. Identified devices were grouped into 3 categories: (1) “recommended,” (2) “suggested,” or (3) “listed.”. Results: Twelve relevant technologies were identified. One was placed in the “recommended” group (“Dysarthria Analyzer”), 6 in the “suggested” group, (“Audeering,” “Aural Analytics,” Canary Speech,” “KI:Elements,” “Modality.ai,” and “Redenlab”), and 5 in the “listed” group (“i-Prognosis,” “No Pa,” and “PdAssist,” as well as “mPower” and “HopkinsPD”). Conclusions: Despite their potential for clinical and research applications, their suitability in real-world environments remains to be determined. © 2025 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.","biometric; machine learning; Parkinson's disease; voice","algorithm; controlled study; disease severity; dysarthria; female; human; machine learning; motor dysfunction; Parkinson disease; prognosis; review; Serinus; severity of illness index; smartphone; speech analysis; validity; voice","","","","","","","Szewczyk-Krolikowski K., Tomlinson P., Nithi K., Wade-Martins R., Talbot K., Ben-Shlomo Y., Hu M.T.M., The influence of age and gender on motor and non-motor features of early Parkinson's disease: initial findings from the Oxford Parkinson disease center (OPDC) discovery cohort, Parkinsonism Relat Disord, 20, pp. 99-105, (2014); Logemann J.A., Fisher H.B., Boshes B., Blonsky E.R., Frequency and Cooccurrence of vocal tract dysfunctions in the speech of a large sample of Parkinson patients, J Speech Hear Disord, 43, pp. 47-57, (1978); Jain A., Abedinpour K., Polat O., Et al., Voice analysis to differentiate the dopaminergic response in people with Parkinson's disease, Front Hum Neurosci, 15, (2021); Despotovic V., Skovranek T., Schommer C., Speech based estimation of Parkinson's disease using Gaussian processes and automatic relevance determination, Neurocomputing, 401, pp. 173-181, (2020); Ma A., Lau K.K., Thyagarajan D., Voice changes in Parkinson's disease: what are they telling us?, J Clin Neurosci, 72, pp. 1-7, (2020); Rektorova I., Mekyska J., Janousova E., Et al., Speech prosody impairment predicts cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease, Parkinsonism Relat Disord, 29, pp. 90-95, (2016); Ryu J., Torres E.B., Motor signatures in digitized cognitive and memory tests enhances characterization of Parkinson's disease, Sensors (Basel), 22, 12, (2022); Rusz J., Cmejla R., Tykalova T., Et al., Imprecise vowel articulation as a potential early marker of Parkinson's disease: effect of speaking task, J Acoust Soc Am, 134, pp. 2171-2181, (2013); Harel B., Cannizzaro M., Snyder P.J., Variability in fundamental frequency during speech in prodromal and incipient Parkinson's disease: a longitudinal case study, Brain Cogn, 56, pp. 24-29, (2004); Rusz J., Hlavnicka J., Novotny M., Et al., Speech biomarkers in rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and Parkinson disease, Ann Neurol, 90, pp. 62-75, (2021); Hlavnicka J., Cmejla R., Tykalova T., Sonka K., Ruzicka E., Rusz J., Automated analysis of connected speech reveals early biomarkers of Parkinson's disease in patients with rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, Sci Rep, 7, (2017); Zhang H., Deng K., Li H., Albin R.L., Guan Y., Deep learning identifies digital biomarkers for self-reported Parkinson's disease, Patterns, 1, (2020); Ozkanca Y., Ozturk M.G., Ekmekci M.N., Atkins D.C., Demiroglu C., Ghomi R.H., Depression screening from voice samples of patients affected by Parkinson's disease, Digit Biomark, 3, pp. 72-82, (2019); Oliveira A.M., Coelho L., Carvalho E., Ferreira-Pinto M.J., Vaz R., Aguiar P., Machine learning for adaptive deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease: closing the loop, J Neurol, 270, pp. 5313-5326, (2023); Evangelista E.G., Belisle-Pipon J., Naunheim M.R., Powell M., Gallois H., Bensoussan Y., Voice as a biomarker in health-tech: mapping the evolving landscape of voice biomarkers in the start-up world, Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg, 171, pp. 340-352, (2024); Menne F., Dorr F., Schrader J., Troger J., Habel U., Konig A., Wagels L., The voice of depression: speech features as biomarkers for major depressive disorder, BMC Psychiatry, 24, (2024); Zhang L., Duvvuri R., Chandra K.K.L., Nguyen T., Ghomi R.H., Automated voice biomarkers for depression symptoms using an online cross-sectional data collection initiative, Depress Anxiety, 37, pp. 657-669, (2020); Rusz J., Krack P., Tripoliti E., From prodromal stages to clinical trials: the promise of digital speech biomarkers in Parkinson's disease, Neurosci Biobehav Rev, 167, (2024); Darley F.L., Aronson A.E., Brown J.R., Differential diagnostic patterns of dysarthria, J Speech Hear Res, 12, pp. 246-269, (1969); Canter G.J., Speech characteristics of patients with Parkinson's disease: III.

Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning (DL), have significantly enhanced PD diagnosis through the analysis of speech data. Nevertheless, the progress of research is restricted by the limited availability of publicly accessible speech-based PD datasets, primarily due to privacy concerns. The goal of this systematic review is to explore the current landscape of speech-based DL approaches for PD classification, based on 33 scientific works published between January 2020 and March 2024. We discuss their available resources, capabilities, and potential limitations, and issues related to bias, explainability, and privacy. Furthermore, this review provides an overview of publicly accessible speech-based datasets and open-source material for PD. The DL approaches identified are categorized into end-to-end (E2E) learning, transfer learning (TL), and deep acoustic feature extraction (DAFE). Among E2E approaches, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are prevalent, though Transformers are increasingly popular. E2E approaches face challenges such as limited data and computational resources, especially with Transformers. TL addresses these issues by providing more robust PD diagnosis and better generalizability across languages. DAFE aims to improve the explainability and interpretability of results by examining the specific effects of deep features on both other DL approaches and more traditional machine learning (ML) methods. However, it often underperforms compared to E2E and TL approaches. © 2024 by the authors.","Artificial Intelligence; deep acoustic feature extraction; deep learning; end-to-end; Parkinson’s disease; speech classification; speech diagnosis; speech processing; transfer learning","Contrastive Learning; Convolutional neural networks; Data privacy; Deep learning; Federated learning; Transfer learning; Acoustic feature extraction; Deep acoustic feature extraction; Deep learning; Disease classification; End to end; Learning approach; Parkinson’s disease; Speech classification; Speech diagnose; Transfer learning; Adversarial machine learning","","","","","Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO, (NGF.1607.22.013); Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","This research was funded by the NWO research programme NGF AiNed Fellowship Grants under the project Responsible AI for Voice Diagnostics (RAIVD)\u2014grant number NGF.1607.22.013.","Ngo Q.C., Motin M.A., Pah N.D., Drotar P., Kempster P., Kumar D., Computerized analysis of speech and voice for Parkinson’s disease: A systematic review, Comput.

With approximately 10 million people diagnosed globally—1 to 1.8 per 1,000 individuals, according to reports by the Japan Times and the Parkinson Foundation—early and accurate diagnosis of PD is crucial for improving patient outcomes. While numerous studies have utilized machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for PD recognition, existing surveys are limited in scope, often focusing on single data modalities and failing to capture the potential of multimodal approaches. To address these gaps, this study presents a comprehensive review of PD recognition systems across diverse data modalities, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), gait-based pose analysis, gait sensory data, handwriting analysis, speech test data, Electroencephalography (EEG), and multimodal fusion techniques. Based on over 342 articles from leading scientific databases, this review examines key aspects such as data collection methods, settings, feature representations, and system performance, with a focus on recognition accuracy and robustness. Notably, limitations such as the lack of robust multimodal frameworks and challenges in continuous PD recognition are identified, underscoring the need for innovative solutions. The review highlights significant advancements in PD recognition, particularly the transition from handcrafted feature engineering to DL-based methods. Furthermore, it explores promising trends in multimodal approaches, offering insights into overcoming existing challenges such as data scarcity, model generalization, and computational efficiency. The study emphasizes the importance of integrating diverse data sources to achieve higher diagnostic accuracy and reliability. This survey aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers, providing actionable guidance for the development of next-generation PD recognition systems. By leveraging diverse data modalities and cutting-edge machine learning paradigms, this work contributes to advancing the state of PD diagnostics and improving patient care through innovative, multimodal approaches. © 2013 IEEE.","audio signal; deep learning; EEG signal; handwriting; machine learning; MRI; Multi-modality dataset; PD recognition; pose; speech; video; voice","Deep learning; Electroencephalography; Electrotherapeutics; Taxonomies; Cognitive impairment; Disease detection; Leap motion; Machine-learning; MDS-UPDRS; Motor function; Multi-modal approach; Neurological disorders; Parkinson's disease; Recognition systems; Neurodegenerative diseases","","","","","University of Aizu, UoA","This work was supported by the Competitive Research Fund of The University of Aizu, Japan.","Kulkarni S.P., Parkinson’s disease from an Ayurveda perspective: Opportunities and challenges for further research, Translational Models of Parkinson’ S Disease and Related Movement Disorders, pp. 345-360, (2024); Dauer W., Przedborski S., Parkinson’s disease: Mechanisms and models, Neuron, 39, 6, pp. 889-909, (2003); Perlmutter J.S., Assessment of Parkinson disease manifestations, Current Protocols Neurosci, 49, 1, pp. 1-10, (2009); Rizzo G., Copetti M., Arcuti S., Martino D., Fontana A., Logroscino G., Accuracy of clinical diagnosis of Parkinson disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis, Neurology, 86, 6, pp. 566-576, (2016); Lamba R., Gulati T., Alharbi H.F., Jain A., A hybrid system for Parkinson’s disease diagnosis using machine learning techniques, Int.

Early diagnosis is challenging as disease phenotype is very crucial for predicting, preventing the progression, and effective drug discovery. In the last few years, Deep learning (DL) based neural networks are the state-of-the-art models deployed in industries and academics across different areas like natural language processing, image analysis, speech recognition, audio classification, and many more It has been slowly realized that they have a high potential in medical image analysis and diagnostics and medical management in general. As this field is vast and expanding rapidly, we have put focused on existing DL-based models to detect Alzheimer’s and Parkinson's in particular. This study gives a summary of related medical examinations for these diseases. Frameworks and applications of many deep learning models have been discussed. We have given precise notes on pre-processing techniques used by various studies for MRI image analysis. An overview of the application of DL-based models in different stages of medical image analysis has been conferred. It has been realized from the review that more studies are focused on Alzheimer's compared to Parkinson's disease Additionally, we have tabulated the various public datasets available for these diseases. We have highlighted the potential use of a novel biomarker for the early diagnosis of these disorders. Also, some challenges and issues in implementing deep learning techniques for the detection of these diseases have been addressed. Finally, We concluded with some future research directions regarding deep learning techniques for diagnosis of the above diseases. © 2024 The Author(s).

Its diagnosis is challenging and mainly relies on clinical aspects. At present, no biomarker is available to obtain a diagnosis of certainty in vivo. Objective: The present review aims at describing machine learning algorithms as they have been variably applied to different aspects of Parkinson’s disease diagnosis and characterization. Methods: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed in December 2019, resulting in 230 publications obtained with the following search query: “Machine Learning” “AND” “Parkinson Disease”. Results: The obtained publications were divided into 6 categories, based on different application fields: “Gait Analysis - Motor Evaluation”, “Upper Limb Motor and Tremor Evaluation”, “Handwriting and typing evaluation”, “Speech and Phonation evaluation”, “Neuroimaging and Nuclear Medicine evaluation”, “Metabolomics application”, after excluding the papers of general topic. As a result, a total of 166 articles were analyzed after elimination of papers written in languages other than English or not directly related to the selected topics. Conclusion: Machine learning algorithms are computer-based statistical approaches that can be trained and are able to find common patterns from big amounts of data. The machine learning approaches can help clinicians in classifying patients according to several variables at the same time. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.","Gait analysis; Handwriting analysis; Machine learning; Metabolomics; Neuroimaging; Parkinson disease; Speech analysis","Algorithms; Humans; Machine Learning; Neuroimaging; Parkinson Disease; clinical feature; functional magnetic resonance imaging; gait; handwriting; human; machine learning; metabolomics; motor activity; motor performance; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear medicine; Parkinson disease; phonation; positron emission tomography; Review; single photon emission computed tomography; speech analysis; systematic review; tremor; typing; upper limb; algorithm; machine learning; Parkinson disease","","","","","","","Twelves D., Perkins K.S., Counsell C., Systematic review of incidence studies of Parkinson’s disease, Mov.

Importantly, various ML models were developed to address the complexity of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) diagnosis. PD is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor and non-motor disorders where its syndromes affect the daily lives of patients. Several Computer Aided Diagnosis and Detection (CADD) systems based on hand-crafted ML algorithms achieved promising results in distinguishing PD patients from Healthy Control (HC) subjects and other Parkinsonian syndrome categories using clinical data (e.g., speech and gait impairments) and medical imaging [e.g., Position Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT)]. Despite the good performance of hand-crafted ML algorithms, there is still a problem linked to the features’ extraction and selection. In fact, Deep Learning DL has provided an ultimate solution for the features’ extraction and selection related issue. An important number of studies on the diagnosis of PD using DL algorithms were developed recently. This study provides an overview of the application of hand-crafted ML algorithms and DL techniques for PD diagnosis. It also introduces key concepts for understanding the application of ML methods to diagnose PD. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020.","","Computer aided diagnosis; Computer control systems; Deep learning; Extraction; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Neurodegenerative diseases; Particle beams; Clinical data; Daily lives; Disease diagnosis; Feature extraction and selection; Machine learning algorithms; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Position emission tomography; Subfields; Tomography imaging; Single photon emission computed tomography","","","","","","","Mellit A., Kalogirou S.A., Artificial intelligence techniques for photovoltaic applications: A review, Prog.

Despite the advancements in treatment strategies, the management of PD is still a challenging event. Early prediction and diagnosis of PD are of utmost importance for effective management of PD. In addition, the classification of patients with PD as compared to normal healthy individuals also imposes drawbacks in the early diagnosis of PD. To address these challenges, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models have been implicated in the diagnosis, prediction, and treatment of PD. Recent times have also demonstrated the implication of AI and ML models in the classification of PD based on neuroimaging methods, speech recording, gait abnormalities, and others. Herein, we have briefly discussed the role of AI and ML in the diagnosis, treatment, and identification of novel biomarkers in the progression of PD. We have also highlighted the role of AI and ML in PD management through altered lipidomics and gut-brain axis. We briefly explain the role of early PD detection through AI and ML algorithms based on speech recordings, handwriting patterns, gait abnormalities, and neuroimaging techniques. Further, the review discuss the potential role of the metaverse, the Internet of Things, and electronic health records in the effective management of PD to improve the quality of life. Lastly, we also focused on the implementation of AI and ML-algorithms in neurosurgical process and drug discovery. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence; Gait abnormalities; Internet of things; Machine learning; Parkinson's disease; Telemedicine systems","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Machine Learning; Parkinson Disease; Quality of Life; adenosine A2a receptor; amantadine; amine oxidase (flavin containing) isoenzyme A; amine oxidase (flavin containing) isoenzyme B; biological marker; clonidine; cryopyrin; dabrafenib; diuretic agent; dopamine; dopamine 2 receptor; dopamine receptor; dopamine transporter; indole derivative; levodopa; lipidome; muscarinic M1 receptor; muscarinic M2 receptor; muscarinic M3 receptor; muscarinic M4 receptor; muscarinic M5 receptor; piperazine derivative; prebiotic agent; probiotic agent; proteome; pyrimidine derivative; sulfonamide; synbiotic agent; tetrahydrocannabinol; transcriptome; adult; algorithm; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; audio recording; brain disease; brain-gut axis; cognitive defect; controlled study; convolutional neural network; dancing; data base; deep learning; deep neural network; diagnostic imaging; disease severity; drawing; drug repositioning; drug targeting; early diagnosis; electroencephalogram; electromyogram; electronic health record; functional magnetic resonance imaging; gait; gait disorder; game; genome-wide association study; handwriting; human; internet of things; intestine flora; lipidomics; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; machine learning; metabolomics; microbiome; nanorobotics; nerve cell; neuroimaging; neurologic disease; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Parkinson disease; physiotherapy; positron emission tomography; prediction; quality of life; random forest; recurrent neural network; Review; single photon emission computed tomography; speech; supervised machine learning; telemedicine; telemonitoring; traditional medicine; unsupervised machine learning; voice; machine learning; Parkinson disease","","amantadine, 665-66-7, 768-94-5; clonidine, 4205-90-7, 4205-91-8, 57066-25-8; dabrafenib, 1195765-45-7, 1195768-06-9; dopamine, 51-61-6, 62-31-7; levodopa, 59-92-7","AIRO II; XGBoost Analysis","","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India, CSIR; Delhi Technological University, DTU","Dr. Rashmi K Ambasta has finished her Master’s degree from the Department of Zoology, Banaras Hindu University.

This study has summarized the literature related to speech and voice in detecting PD and assessing its severity. Methods: A systematic review of the literature from 2010 to 2021 to investigate analysis methods and signal features. The keywords “Automatic analysis” in conjunction with “PD speech” or “PD voice” were used, and the PubMed and ScienceDirect databases were searched. A total of 838 papers were found on the first run, of which 189 were selected. One hundred and forty-seven were found to be suitable for the review. The different datasets, recording protocols, signal analysis methods and features that were reported are listed. Values of the features that separate PD patients from healthy controls were tabulated. Finally, the barriers that limit the wide use of computerized speech analysis are discussed. Results: Speech and voice may be valuable markers for PD. However, large differences between the datasets make it difficult to compare different studies. In addition, speech analytic methods that are not informed by physiological understanding may alienate clinicians.

Early and precise diagnosis is vital for effective medical intervention and enhancing the quality level of life for patients. This review provides an extensive overview of current PD detection methods, emphasizing the integration of neuroimaging techniques, clinical data, and advanced computational algorithms. A wide range of neuroimaging modalities are examined by highlighting their roles in identifying structural and functional brain changes linked to PD. The review also explores the potential of datasets such as handwritten samples, Electroencephalography (EEG), Electrocardiography (ECG), voice recordings, gait analysis, and sensor data for PD detection. The review discusses various stages of data processing, including preprocessing, segmentation, and feature extraction, essential for improving the accuracy and efficiency of diagnostic models. The application of machine learning, deep learning, and transfer learning models for PD classification and prediction is reviewed, focusing on feature selection, model optimization, and the utilization of large, diverse datasets. AI systems can provide reliable and accurate Parkinson's disease (PD) identification, enabling more efficient and prompt therapeutic treatments, by utilizing these sophisticated algorithms and a variety of datasets. © 2013 IEEE.","dataset; machine learning; Parkinsons disease; segmentation; transfer learning","Contrastive Learning; Deep learning; Electrocardiography; Functional neuroimaging; Neurodegenerative diseases; Transfer learning; Central nervous systems; Dataset; Detection and diagnosis; Disease detection; Disease diagnosis; Machine-learning; Neurodegenerative; Parkinson's disease; Segmentation; Transfer learning; Electroencephalography","","","","","Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India","This work was supported by the Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India.","Souza R., Winder A., Stanley E.A.M., Vigneshwaran V., Camacho M., Camicioli R., Monchi O., Wilms M., Forkert N.D., Identifying biases in a multicenter MRI database for Parkinson’s disease classification: Is the disease classifier a secret site classifier?, IEEE J.

To effectively utilise these biomarkers, it is essential to understand how they evolve over time as this degenerative disease progresses. Objectives: This review aims to identify the most used vocal features in Parkinson’s disease monitoring and to track the temporal changes observed in each feature. Methods: An online database search was conducted to identify studies on voice and speech changes associated with Parkinson’s disease progression. The analysis examined the features and their temporal changes to identify potential feature classes and trends. Results: Eighteen features were identified and categorised into three main aspects of speech: articulation, phonation and prosody. While twelve of these features exhibited measurable variations in Parkinsonian voices compared to those of healthy individuals, insights into long-term changes were limited. Conclusions: Vocal features can effectively discriminate Parkinsonian voices and may be used to monitor changes through disease progression. These changes remain underexplored and necessitate more evidence from long-term studies. The additional evidence could provide clinical insights into the disease and enhance the effectiveness of automated voice-based monitoring. © 2025 by the authors.","monitoring; Parkinson’s disease; progression; vocal features","apraxia of speech; artificial neural network; behavior assessment; cognition; cross validation; degenerative disease; disease duration; disease exacerbation; disease severity; entropy; excitation and stimulation; human; joint; machine learning; nervousness; Parkinson disease; parkinsonism; perception; phonation; prosody; REM sleep; Review; self evaluation; signal noise ratio; speech rate; systematic review; Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale; vocalization; voice analysis; vowel","","","","","","","Alster P., Otto-Slusarczyk D., Migda A., Migda B., Struga M., Friedman A., Role of orexin in pathogenesis of neurodegenerative parkinsonisms, Neurol.
